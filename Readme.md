# IEW C Essentials

Some utilities I use in my vulkan projects. This is my first C project 
using the really great [JetBrains CLion IDE][2].

## macros.h

Macros used to create typed vectors and vector apis.

## string.h

UTF-8 String utilities. Uses [sheredom/utf8.h][1] under the hood.
Some code from [sheredom/utf8.h][1] was copied and adapted to our
needs.
